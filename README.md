# Calculator
*This runs on Java

When you copy the code and input to whatever Java workspace you use, just run it and play around with the calculator.

Button functionality when you run the code:
- The D (delete) in the top right corner deletes the most recent input starting from the right. Let's say you put in 23, if you click the D button, it will get rid of the 3 leaving only the 2.
- The C button next to the delete button clears tho whole text field for the output. While the delete button only deletes one number, then clear button clears it all.
- The rest of the buttons are pretty self-explanatory, the number button for the numbers you want to calculate, the operations on the right which is used to calculate the number inputed depending on the operation, and then finally a . button so that you can use decimals when doing the calculations.

If you have a bunch of decimal numbers in the output field, you can click in the output box and use your arrow keys to look through the number.
