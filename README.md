# Calculator
Java code that creates a simple calculator UI with basic operations like multiplication and division and other stuff.

When you download the file, all you have to do is run the code and a small little calculator UI will pop up.

Button functionality when you run the code:
- The D (delete) in the top right corner deletes the most recent input starting from the right. Let's say you put in 23, if you click the D button, it will get rid of the 3 leaving only the 2.
- The C button next to the delete button clears tho whole text field for the output. While the delete button only deletes one number, then clear button clears it all.
- The rest of the buttons are pretty self-explanatory, the number button for the numbers you want to calculate, the operations on the right which is used to calculate the number inputed depending on the operation, and then finally a . button so that you can use decimals when doing the calculations.

If you have a bunch of decimal numbers in the output field, you can click in the output box and use your arrow keys to look through the number.
